## Personal Project

>A simple game in which you move around a circle. With a menu that has a couple buttons that do things like putting the circle in the middle of the screen or a random location, changing the color of the circle or something else. I would like to code the values of velocity, speed, and boundaries in rust, display the circle in JavaScript, and make the buttons in HTML and CSS.
